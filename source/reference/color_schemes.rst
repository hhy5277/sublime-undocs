Overview
========

Color schemes define the colors
used to highlight source code in Sublime Text views
and to style different elements
found in the editing area:
background, foreground, selection, caret...


File Format
===========

Color scheme files use the Property List format
and have the .tmTheme extension.

The file format of color scheme files
is inherited from Textmate.

.. note::

   Sublime Text uses the .tmTheme extension for color scheme files
   to maintain compatibility with Textmate.
   Rather confusingly, Sublime Text also has a notion
   of a user interface (UI) theme.
   A UI theme is a set of styles and decorations
   to alter the look of the editor’s UI.
   It’s important to remember
   that UI themes and color schemes
   are two different customization mechanisms.
   Generally speaking, it is far less complex
   to create a new color scheme
   than it is to create a new UI theme.


Where to Store Color Schemes
============================

You can keep color scheme files anywhere under Packages
(even inside directories nested multiple levels deep).

By convention, directories containing
a set of color scheme files
have the *Color Scheme -* prefix.
For example: *Color Scheme - Default*.

The file names of all available color schemes
are displayed in the **Preferences → Color Scheme** menu.


Selecting a Color Scheme
************************

You can change the current color scheme
by means of the **Preferences → Color Scheme** menu.

A common way of selecting a color scheme
is by associating it to a type of file
using the file-type-specific settings.
For example, for the Python file type (``syntax_file`` == :file:`Python.tmLanguage`),
we'd use the :file:`Python.sublime-settings` file
and, within, set ``color_scheme`` to some color scheme file.

For more information about settings, see :doc:`settings`.


Structure of a Color Scheme File
================================

Color scheme files are based
on the Property List format.
All color scheme files share
the same topmost structure.

Colors can be expressed in the
following formats: ``#RRGGBB``, ``#RGB``.

Most elements controlling colors
accept an alpha channel value:
``#RRGGBBAA``.
